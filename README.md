# Formal Methods for Software Engineering Exercises with autograding

This repository contains the exercises for the *Formal Methods for Software Engineering* course at the Bauhaus-UniversitÃ¤t Weimar.
Each submodule contains a different exercise. The following Table lists the exercises, corresponding submodule, and the original repository.

## Autograding and GitHub Classroom 

All repositories support autograding via GitHub Classroom. Autograding uses GitHub Actions to run test cases (JUnit) and extract reports from the test results. The tests can be used for feedback when working on the tasks locally (where GitHub Actions are not executed).

We describe the migration from regular worksheets to GitHub Classroom in this experience report:
